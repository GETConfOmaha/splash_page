              <p>From my point of view, MMD was a huge success. We had a good turnout, the audience was great, the pros were enthusiastic and presented killer material, the venue was amazing, and everything went off without a hitch, really— especially with it being two years since the last event. I was at that one, and for my money, this one was a big improvement.

              <h2>Me Myself and Design</h2>
              <h4>Event Chair - AIGA Nebraska</h4>
              <p>After being away for almost two years AIGA Nebraska sought out to bring back Me, Myself, and Design MMD a student focused design conference, to it's yearly programming. I was voted on to organize and execute the event for 2016. The limitations I was given were: that it had to be in Lincoln, Nebraska, 45 minutes away from where I reside, or halfway in between Omaha and Lincoln. and the budget was set at $1200.00 already.</p>
              <p>With the experience of not only attending MMD in prior years but also previously residing on the board, I set a handfull of my own goals to help direct my decision making. They were as follows:</p>
              <ul class="project__content__list">
                <li><b>Diverse speakers –</b> haven't spoken for AIGA Nebraska before, broad range of subjects, range in experience, gender, and other demographics.</li>
                <li><b> Diverse attendees – </b>univeristy and comunitiy College students, different years in schooling, and other other demographics.
                </li>
                <li><b>Inclusive food choices –</b> providing a variety of choices for attendees through out the day</li>
                <li><b>No additional costs –</b> mainly for parking, wanted the ticket to cover attende's needs for the day</li>
                <li><b>Reusable Logo –</b> years prior recreated a logo and accompanying materials each year, taking a lot of time and resources. I wanted to have a logo that could/would be used year after year and aleviate that pain point.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> Each goal was met, with the additional accomplishments of securing the location and food under budget. Obtaining 10 portfolio reviewers from local agencies. Having three keynote speakers and 10 additional pannel speakers through out the day. As well as providing art direction for all materials and mentoring the co-chair for when they lead the following year.</p>
