            <p>Noticing that all emails sent by the University were plain text and did not include the logo, I created templates for the Grad School. A logo header, body copy with variations of image placement, and button looks and a footer were created for four departments. It's now being adapted to undergrad emails this year.</p>

              <h4>Creighton University</h4>
              <p>The Grad School website hadn't been updated in about four years. Tasked with redisgn but also progressive enhancements I found pages that could benifit the most with upgrades. As navigation changes were put on hold. I worked with the analytics specalist to identify high traffic pages noted by Google and Slate, our student applicant tracker. Then created a priority list of pages to update, and collaborated with the two writters on content and new layout options. I kept to University Communication's standards but also improved usability through organization of content. In the case of Speak with an Enrollment Specalist page, pictured at left, pictures of recruiters were added, directions were consolodated to two consise lines and a Google map was embeded.</p>

            <h2>Site Enhancements</h2>
            <h4>Creighton University</h4>
            <p><b>Improved Program Navigation</b><br/>The table on each subdomain would make a user travel back to www.creighton.edu, or stay within www.creighton.edu which is highly undergrad focused. Now when a user selects a grad program they are sent to the gradschool subdomain. The same goes for business programs.</p>
            <p><b>Conditional Request Form Buttons</b><br/>A program page has a button called request for information, but there are three request information forms created by the university. An overall one, a Heider College of Business one and a Grad one. I created javascript code to detect the subdomain and send them to the correct RFI. Instead of a user being on gradschool.creighton.edu and clicking on a business program then being directed to Heider request information form. When they may not of been introduced who or what Heider is.</p>
            <p><b>Linking to an Open Accordion</b><br/>University Communication team often uses accordions on the website. Our team wanted to link to an open one in an email communication, but the feature wasn't available. I created code, that could be added to the page for this to happen, and how-to's so other teams could use it as well.</p>

              <p>From my point of view, MMD was a huge success. We had a good turnout, the audience was great, the pros were enthusiastic and presented killer material, the venue was amazing, and everything went off without a hitch, really— especially with it being two years since the last event. I was at that one, and for my money, this one was a big improvement.

              <h2>Me Myself and Design</h2>
              <h4>Event Chair - AIGA Nebraska</h4>
              <p>After being away for almost two years AIGA Nebraska sought out to bring back Me, Myself, and Design MMD a student focused design conference, to it's yearly programming. I was voted on to organize and execute the event for 2016. The limitations I was given were: that it had to be in Lincoln, Nebraska, 45 minutes away from where I reside, or halfway in between Omaha and Lincoln. and the budget was set at $1200.00 already.</p>
              <p>With the experience of not only attending MMD in prior years but also previously residing on the board, I set a handfull of my own goals to help direct my decision making. They were as follows:</p>
              <ul class="project__content__list">
                <li><b>Diverse speakers –</b> haven't spoken for AIGA Nebraska before, broad range of subjects, range in experience, gender, and other demographics.</li>
                <li><b> Diverse attendees – </b>univeristy and comunitiy College students, different years in schooling, and other other demographics.
                </li>
                <li><b>Inclusive food choices –</b> providing a variety of choices for attendees through out the day</li>
                <li><b>No additional costs –</b> mainly for parking, wanted the ticket to cover attende's needs for the day</li>
                <li><b>Reusable Logo –</b> years prior recreated a logo and accompanying materials each year, taking a lot of time and resources. I wanted to have a logo that could/would be used year after year and aleviate that pain point.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> Each goal was met, with the additional accomplishments of securing the location and food under budget. Obtaining 10 portfolio reviewers from local agencies. Having three keynote speakers and 10 additional pannel speakers through out the day. As well as providing art direction for all materials and mentoring the co-chair for when they lead the following year.</p>
